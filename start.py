# Probably your most valuable Python resource, right after python.org.
# Spot Python luminaries in their native habitat! 
# Don't be surprised to have your questions answered by the original programmer or the author of the book open on your desk!
# The best thing about comp.lang.python is how "newbie-friendly" the mail group is.
# You can ask any question and never get a "RTFM" thrown back at you.
